## What is Audio Hijack?

**Audio Hijack** is a professional-level audio capture utility that enables you to intercept, record, route, and process sound from any app or hardware source. Instead of being tied to one input, you can build a chain of blocks — recorders, visual meters, effect modules, and more — and assemble them into a complete signal flow that fits your workflow.  

This is ideal for podcasters who need isolated tracks from conferencing apps, creators who want clean browser stream capture, musicians who need to route instruments and add effects, or anyone who needs to log and archive audio from multiple origins in perfect control.  

Audio Hijack supports real-time processing with AU plugins, high bitrate formats, multi-source capture sessions, multi-channel recording, and is optimized for modern Apple Silicon performance.  

Whether you need to record voice calls, streaming audio, training material, radio stations, podcasts, or app sound routing — Audio Hijack is one of the most powerful and direct ways to manage any audio source in your system.
